# Modifying rules

You can modify your rules by either editing _parameters.json_ or by running `rdk modify` command which takes the same arguments and options as `rdk create` command. Note that modifying your rule locally does not modify the rule in your AWS Account and you need to redeploy the rule to apply the changes.
