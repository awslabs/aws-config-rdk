Rule Development Kit - Version 2
This tool should be considered in "Open Beta".  I would greatly appreciate feedback and bug reports at mborch@amazon.com!

The RDK is designed to support a "Compliance-as-Code" workflow that is intuitive and productive.  It abstracts away much of the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying AWS Config rules backed by custom lambda functions, and provides a streamlined develop-deploy-monitor iterative process.
